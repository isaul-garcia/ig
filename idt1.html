      Android 11 features several new features, many of which are focused around messaging and notifications. The notifications will now show a separate section for messaging apps, which will help separate messages from other notifications on your phone. The new Bubbles feature, an absolute rip-off of the Facebook Chat Heads, will show floating elements on the edge of the screen, which houses recent chats from all your messaging apps.
